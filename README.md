# AudioScope-ng2
AudioScope demo written in Angular 2 + TypeScript

This demo is broken into stages, so you can start with a basic HTML+JS app and convert it to Angular 2+TS a step at a time.

## Stage 1

Our starting app, written in HTML+JS.

## Stage 2

Move to .ts files, creating a blank tsconfig.json, and adding a few casts.

## Stage 3

Move to using classes and a few type annotations.

## Stage 4 (optional)

Move to using a class hierarchy and generics.  

## Stage 5

Move to modules and compiling to AMD.

## Stage 6

Move to using Angular 2 and rendering our first component.

## Stage 7

Move to using Angular 2 for the whole application.  We switch from a canvas to using SVG (more friendly to being declarative), and we preload the audio files to simplify switching.  We also throw in a few buttons for good measure.
